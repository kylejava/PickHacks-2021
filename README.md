# PickHacks 2021

## PokeCatcher

## Inspiration

Recently, I was really motivated to learning how to create a game. I knew games could be created through Python through a library called Pygame. I looked up a tutorial on YouTube and learned the bare minimum of Pygame, all I was able to do was create a small square sprite and control it with the arrow keys. I really wanted to learn more about Pygame and video game development, so I joined PickHacks to devote some time into making a game. I knew I wanted to make a simple game so I thought of making a snake like game, but felt like it needed to be more challenging. So, I created a snake like game but used Pokemon sprites. I chose the main character sprite from Pokemon LeafGreen and Pokemon FireRed as the player, and walk around collecting Pokemon.

## What it does

PokeCatcher is a simple game where you control Red, the main character, and walk around the screen collecting Pokemon. Your goal is to collect as many pokemon as you can in under 30 seconds.

## How we built it

The game was built using Python and Pygame. The sprites were from various different websites, and the background was made in Figma.

## Challenges we ran into

Since this was my first time making a game I ran into a lot of trouble, like how/where to get the sprites, collision, sprite behavior, keeping score, and so much more. My biggest challenge was figuring out how the program will detect collision when the main character touches a Pokemon. Another challenge was figuring out how to get random pokemon from the list, I didn't want them to show up on the screen in the order of PokeDex.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Being able to create a simple yet complete game in under a short amount of time. As mentioned, I joined this hackathon to really motivate myself and see how far I could get when creating a game. I had only used Pygame once to create a simple sprite, and I could tell how much I have improved in under two days. I was able to take a simple sprite on a screen and add different variables of a video game, like keeping score, interaction between other sprites, boundaries, and so much more.

## What we learned

Learning how to create a game with Pygame.

## What's next for PokeCatcher
I want to implement more Pokemon, as for now it only has the original 151 Pokemon. I also want to include a way for the character to go to different maps when playing, that way there could be a water screen that has water Pokemon, or a forest screen that has Grass Pokemon. I want to give the user the ability to explore more than the 500x500 screen with just trees and grass. I also want to implement an online scoreboard so that way people could play for the top spot.
